there's a serious point in the fist panel of this comic. 

using the wrong metrics can be really really bad. can we use reductio ad absurdum (like the gzip response) to exclude some bad metrics? what kind of error is this aproach going to run into?

Why do some (inexperienced?) developers have these impulses to try to "improve" our code in a bad direction? Is is puzzle-solvingness? I'm noticing some of this impulse in factorio as well.
how do we identify the sources of bad  impulses/habits, and set ourselves up for success via low friction and low cognitive-burden incentives.
